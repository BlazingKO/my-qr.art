            <h1>What is it?</h1>

            <p>With <a href="https://my-qr.art">My-QR.art</a> you can make QR
            codes that look like <em>you</em> want them to
            look. <a href="https://my-qr.art">My-QR.art</a> uses a unique
            approach to allow you to change up to 80% of your QR code, when
            other solutions on the web only allow up to 30%. Still you can let
            your QR code go to any URL you want! By giving your QR code a
            recognizable design, for example utilizing your logo, you can
            improve engagement, make your add stand out and increase the chance
            that your QR code is scanned.</p>

            <h1>How does it work?</h1>

            <p>Open the QR designer by pressing the big blue <em>Design your
            QR</em> button on the top of this page. There you can draw how you
            want the QR code to look, or simply upload any black and white image
            to set as the design. When you are done with your design, type in
            the URL for your QR code on the top of the page and press <em>Create
            QR</em>. The QR code will be generated for you in just a second and will
            work immediately!</p>

            <h1>But how is this possible?</h1>

            <p>If you want to know the nitty-gritty technical details,
            basically, instead of simply creating a QR code from your URL, we
            create data that fits your design and redirects to this
            domain. Then we can redirect that exact URL to your URL. This way
            the QR has your design but still redirects wherever you
            want. Technically this is not without it's challenges, QR codes are
            quite complex! If you want to know more, check
            out <a href="https://github.com/raatmarien/my-qr.art">the code on
            GitHub</a>.</p>

            <h1>Is it free?</h1>

            <p>Yes! <a href="https://my-qr.art">My-QR.art</a> is completely free
              to use and has no advertisements! You don't need to sign up or
              create an account. Simply create a QR code with the editor and
              share it with whomever you want! However, it costs money to host
              this site, so sadly at this point I can't guarantee your QR codes
              will work forever.</p>
