    <p>QR codes usually look boring, but with this tool you can make your
      QR look however you want! Simply choose the version (size) of the QR
      code you want to make and download the template. This template is an
      image file with in white where you can freely choose how the code
      will look and in grey the reserved area. In black and white draw the
      QR design you want on here. Then save it without any
      transparency.</p>

      <label for="version">Version (between 1 and 40):</label>
      <input type="number" id="version" name="version" min="1" max="40 ">

      <input type="submit" value="Get QR template" >
    </form>
